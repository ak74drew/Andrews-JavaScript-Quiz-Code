# Andrews-JavaScript-Quiz-Code

This quiz consists of five random questions about JavaScript.
There is a timer indicating you have 90 seconds to finish the quiz.
If the user selects the wrong answer, they are deducted 10 seconds of time.
Once either the time limit is up, or they simply finish all 5 questions, they are given a score.
Once given a score, they are asked to put their name and then once they click submit, their score is then added to the High Scores.
The high scores are listed.
